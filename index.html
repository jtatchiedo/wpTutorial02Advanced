                    Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? Fry, you can't just sit here in the dark listening to classical music. No! Don't jump! Ooh, name it after me!

                    For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. One hundred dollars. Stop! Don't shoot fire stick in space canoe! Cause explosive decompression!

                    You don't know how to do any of those. Hey, what kinda party is this? There's no booze and only one hooker. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Who am I making this out to? Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them?

                    No. We're on the top. But I've never been to the moon! All I want is to be a monkey of moderate intelligence who wears a suit… that's why I'm transferring to business school! Your best is an idiot!

                    Calculon is gonna kill us and it's all everybody else's fault! You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go. Why did you bring us here? This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!

                    Bender, we're trying our best. Belligerent and numerous. I'll get my kit! And yet you haven't said what I told you to say! How can any of us trust you? No! The cat shelter's on to me. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun!

                    Ow, my spirit! Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Yes! In your face, Gandhi! That's the ONLY thing about being a slave.

                    You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Wow! A superpowers drug you can just rub onto your skin? You'd think it would be something you'd have to freebase.

                    Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! Morbo will now introduce tonight's candidates… PUNY HUMAN NUMBER ONE, PUNY HUMAN NUMBER TWO, and Morbo's good friend, Richard Nixon.

                    I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.

                    Wow, you got that off the Internet? In my day, the Internet was only used to download pornography. That's the ONLY thing about being a slave. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.

                    In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells. You are the last hope of the universe. No! The cat shelter's on to me.

                    Have you ever tried just turning off the TV, sitting down with your children, and hitting them? I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians. Bite my shiny metal ass. I just told you! You've killed me!

                    You are the last hope of the universe. Hello, little man. I will destroy you! Ugh, it's filthy! Why not create a National Endowment for Strip Clubs while we're at it? You're going back for the Countess, aren't you?

                    Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Okay, I like a challenge. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. We don't have a brig. I found what I need. And it's not friends, it's things.

                    A sexy mistake. You can see how I lived before I met you. Negative, bossy meat creature! Who am I making this out to? Ask her how her day was.

                    Ah, yes! John Quincy Adding Machine. He struck a chord with the voters when he pledged not to go on a killing spree. Tell them I hate them. It's toe-tappingly tragic! Aww, it's true. I've been hiding it for so long.

                    Now what? Large bet on myself in round one. I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? It's okay, Bender. I like cooking too.

                    Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually! I'm a thing. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. We're also Santa Claus!

                    Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Leela's gonna kill me. Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. This is the worst kind of discrimination: the kind against me!

                <p>It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Why not indeed!</p>
